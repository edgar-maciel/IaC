## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.[1] The IT infrastructure managed by this comprises both physical equipment such as bare-metal servers as well as virtual machines and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system. It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches. <small> [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) </small>

#### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a set of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products that use operating-system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. <small> [wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)>) </small>

##### Install

To get started with Docker Engine - Community on Ubuntu, make sure you meet the prerequisites, then [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/).

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services, then [install Docker Compose
](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
